  abstract = {Quaker tradition in penal reform is largely understood as an Anglo-American story, focused on the birth of the penitentiary in America and Elizabeth Fry's work in Britain, although it has more distant roots in early Friends' experience of imprisonment, their perfectionist theology, and their insistence that no lawbreaker was beyond redemption. Fry's work was emulated elsewhere in Europe and in Australia, but in reducing penal reform to a strategy for persuading elites to become more humanitarian it arguably depoliticized it. Subsequent Quaker influence on secular penal reform was persistent and benign, revitalized by the legacy of imprisoned conscientious objectors after both World Wars and the Vietnam war. More recent Quaker commitments to Alternatives to Violence (AVP) and restorative justice could usefully be contextualized in the abolitionist thinking that attracted some American and Canadian Quakers in the latetwentieth century, if contemporary penal challenges are to be met.},

  abstract = {Prisoners, Solitude, and Time is an examination of two overlapping aspects of the prison experience that, despite their central importance, have not attracted the scholarly interest they deserve. The first of these is the degree to which prisoners can withstand the rigours of solitude. While the deleterious effects of penal isolation are well known, little systematic attention has been given to the factors associated with surviving, and even triumphing over, prolonged exposure to solitary confinement. The second is how prisoners experience the temporal dimension of their lives, in particular the `survival stratagems' they deploy to reduce the potentially overwhelming prospect of a long, or even indefinite, period behind bars. The book focuses on an aspect of the prison experience---time, its meanderings, measures and meanings---that is seldom considered by academic commentators. It pays particular attention to the use of administrative segregation in what have become known as supermax prisons. The argument advanced in the book is built upon a wide range of prisoner narratives which are analysed in conjunction with academic critiques, official publications, personal communications, field visits, newspaper articles, administrative statistics, the reports of campaigning bodies, and other data. The book concludes with a series of reflections on hope, the search for meaning, post-traumatic growth, and the art of living.},

Sexually and physically abused by her father, Eve has struggled her whole life from this betrayal, longing for an honest reckoning from a man who is long dead. After years of work as an anti-violence activist, she decided she would wait no longer; an apology could be imagined, by her, for her, to her. The Apology, written by Eve from her father's point of view in the words she longed to hear, attempts to transform the abuse she suffered with unflinching truthfulness, compassion, and an expansive vision for the future. Through The Apology Eve has set out to provide a new way for herself and a possible road for others, so that survivors of abuse may finally envision how to be free. She grapples with questions she has sought answers to since she first realized the impact of her father's abuse on her life: How do we offer a doorway rather than a locked cell? How do we move from humiliation to revelation, from curtailing behavior to changing it, from condemning perpetrators to calling them to reckoning? What will it take for abusers to genuinely apologize? Remarkable and original, The Apology is an acutely transformational look at how, from the wounds of sexual abuse, we can begin to re-emerge and heal. It is revolutionary, asking everything of each of us: courage, honesty, and forgiveness."--Jacket},
