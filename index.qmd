I am a criminologist and prison researcher, currently working on parole and prison release mechanisms.

Most of my work has been driven by curiosity about how people survive and (sometimes) find positive, redemptive experiences, after being forced to serve a lengthy prison sentence imposed for a serious offence. I think about this as a human question with relevance and interest beyond its mere criminological or policy implications.
