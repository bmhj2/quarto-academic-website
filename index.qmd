I am a criminologist and prison researcher, currently working on parole and prison release mechanisms.

My work is driven by curiosity: about how people survive and (sometimes) find positive, redemptive experiences, when they are forced by a serious conviction to spend a large part of their lives in prison. To me, this is a human question of interest beyond criminology and criminal justice policy.
